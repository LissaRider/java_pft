Feature: Groups

  Scenario Outline: Group creation
    Given a set of groups
    When I create a new group with name "<name>", header "<header>" and footer "<footer>"
    Then the new set of groups is equal to the old set with the added group

    Examples:
      | name      | header      | footer      |
      | test name | test header | test footer |
